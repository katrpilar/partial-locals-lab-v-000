Classroom Info
<p>
<%= @classroom.course_name %>
<%= @classroom.semester %>
</p>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render partial: "classroom", locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>

<%if @classroom.students != []%>
  <%@classroom.students.each do |s|%>
    <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: s}%>
  <%end%>
<%end%>
