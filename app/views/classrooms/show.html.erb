Classroom Info
<p>
<%= @classroom.course_name %>
<%= @classroom.semester %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%if !@classroom.students.nil?%>
  <%@classroom.students.each do |student|%>
  <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: student}%>
  <%end%>
<%end%>
